	<h4>NEW POST</h4>
	<h4>Low-Carb vs.Low-Fat Diets: Both Work for Weight Loss</h4>
	<div><img class="kk" src="Images/ab.jpg"></div><p>There are tons of different diet programs to choose from, and they all promise significant weight loss results. For the past few years,however, there's been a very specific debate about low-carb verses low-fat diets. Which diet achieve weight loss faster? Which ones makes it easier to keep the weight off? Which one involves eating more nutritious foods.</p><br>
	<p>Its now time to put the debate to rest as two new research shows that low-carb diets help people to lose slightly more weight over time. But the underlying principle is that many different diet can help achieve weight loss but all depends on the level of committment for it to be effective.</p><br>
       <h4>Low-Carb Diets are Often More Effective</h4>
	    <p>According to a <a class="nn" href="">new study</a> published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, carbs have more of an effect on the body than fat. Tulane University conducted a year-long research study on both Americans and Caucasians from the ages of 20 to mid 70s.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>The participants were split into two groups:those who will get 28% of their daily calories from carbs and those who will  get 40-45% calories from carbs. Those who ate more carbs were instead on low-fat diet, which allowed them to get more than 30% of their daily calories from fat. When the study was over, the low-fat group lost about 4 pounds while the low-carb  group lost 12.</p>
	    <br>
	    <h4>Either Diet Can Work Though</h4>
	    <p>While the difference of 8 is significant, it's not exaclty enough to recommend low-carb diet for every one. According to <a class="nn" href="">another new study</a> published in the Journal of American Medical Association, both types of diets often end up having the same result.The study involved meta-analysis of 50 clinical trials and 7,300 overweight participants. After 6 months, it was found that the  low-carb dieters loss 19.2 pounds while the low-fat dieters loss 17.6 pounds. So it doesn't matter the type of diets one takes what matters is the consistency and commitment.</p>
	    <br>
	    <h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
	    <p> Low-carb and low-fat diets can both get results. This is good news because it allows people to potentially choose between the diet that will not involve drastic changes in the existing eating habits.</p>
	    <p>Lastly, never forget that any dieting effort is pointless without exercise. Regardless of one's diet,this fact will never change physical activity is key to losing weight. </p>
