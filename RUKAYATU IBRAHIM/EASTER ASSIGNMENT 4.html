She said in a broken voice, 'I am finished then.' The doctor knew then that she had lied, but it was too late to hide the truth. He looked kindly at her and said, 'I am sorry for you. Why did you lie? Anyway, life and death are matters within Allah's power. Many sick people live long and many healthy ones die.' 
Anfal felt as if she was drowning, as if a hard fist was cruelly squeezing her heart. She tried hard to regain her strength and said, 'I do apologize. Thank you doctor.' 
The doctor encouraged her saying, 'Be strong and optimistic. Medical science is constantly progressing. Some of today's incurable sicknesses can be cured tomorrow; I still have hope. Leave me your telephone number.' She repeated the number automatically without knowing what she was saying. Feeling great shock and bitterness, she again thanked the doctor and left.</p></div><p><div><p>  He did not look at her, but a cloud of sadness covered his face.

She was in a hurry to attend a party and feared she might be late for her appointment with the hairdresser. She never thought the result would be anything important. It was just a precaution insisted upon by her family. 
She had never suffered any serious illness, apart from the odd ache in her limbs. Then, it was her turn to see the doctor. She hurried inside to get it over with as quickly as possible.  She was surprised to see the doctor look sad and concerned as he asked, 'Is this yours?'  She answered, 'No, it is my daughter's.' 
She wanted to know the truth and thought that perhaps he would hide the truth, if she told him it was her own. He asked her to have a seat, so she sat feeling somewhat afraid. She looked at him anxiously, as he said, 'Why did not you send a man to get the results?' Anfal said, 'I was on my way so there was no need to send someone else.' The doctor looked sadly at her and said, 'You seem to be an educated girl. You understand the nature of life.' 
He stopped talking, and she began to tremble. She asked, 'What do you mean doctor?' 
The doctor said, 'The result indicates that there is a blood disease.' He looked down at his papers and remained silent. Anfal had to ask him to give her more information. She cried in fear, 'Is it cancer?'</p></div></div>

Her mother asked, 'Have you been to the doctor? Why did not you go to the hairdresser?â€™  It was just a by-the-way question, needing no answer.  Anfal replied, 'I am not going to the party!' 
She went upstairs into her room and locked the door.  She stretched out on her bed fully clothed and listened to her family's voices, as if they were coming from a far-away place. The wind seemed to her to be a sad funeral tune, lamenting her approaching death. The bedroom seemed strange to her as she would be leaving it soon. What about the house? It would not remember her. She was just a guest. Others would take her room and soon forget her. She tried to cry but tears did not help. 
She looked around her in pain. Those curtains that she had tried so hard to get, would stay after her. It would not have mattered if they had been made of the roughest fabric, she would leave them for others.  She wished she had not troubled herself for such things.  She wished she had saved her time and money for more useful things, which could have been helpful to her in her difficulty. 
She wondered, 'What is useful to me?' She was young, beautiful, and rich with everything her heart could desire. Could anything help her and save her from death? She had always longed for an official job with a good salary. She had it, but could it save her from death? </p></div></div>
